                        <h3>Dragon Heartstring</h3>
                        <p> As a rule, dragon heartstrings produce wands with the most power, and which are capable of
                            the most flamboyant spells. Dragon wands tend to learn more quickly than other types. While
                            they can change allegiance if won from their original master, they always bond strongly with
                            the current owner. The dragon wand tends to be easiest to turn to the Dark Arts, though it
                            will not incline that way of its own accord. It is also the most prone of the three cores to
                            accidents, being somewhat temperamental.</p>
                    </li>
                </a>
                <a>
                    <li><img src="images\unicorn.png">
                        <h3>Unicorn Hair</h3>
                        <p> Unicorn hair generally produces the most consistent magic, and is least subject to
                            fluctuations and blockages. Wands with unicorn cores are generally the most difficult to
                            turn to the Dark Arts. They are the most faithful of all wands, and usually remain strongly
                            attached to their first owner, irrespective of whether he or she was an accomplished witch
                            or wizard.

                            Minor disadvantages of unicorn hair are that they do not make the most powerful wands
                            (although the wand wood may compensate) and that they are prone to melancholy if seriously
                            mishandled, meaning that the hair may ‘die’ and need replacing.</p>
                    </li>
                </a>
                <a>
                    <li><img src="images\phoenix.png">
                        <h3>Phoenix feather</h3>
                        <p> This is the rarest core type. Phoenix feathers are capable of the greatest range of magic,
                            though they may take longer than either unicorn or dragon cores to reveal this. They show
                            the most initiative, sometimes acting of their own accord, a quality that many witches and
                            wizards dislike.

                            Phoenix feather wands are always the pickiest when it comes to potential owners, for the
                            creature from which they are taken is one of the most independent and detached in the world.
                            These wands are the hardest to tame and to personalise, and their allegiance is usually hard
                            won.</p>
                    </li>
                </a>
                <a>
                    <li><img src="images/thestral.png">
                        <h3>Thestral hair</h3>
                        <p> This type of core is not used often. It's an unstable material that is not predictable when
                            used as a wand core. Thestrals are a breed of winged horses only visable to those who had
                            witnessed death at least once. So a wand from thestral hair is powerful but tricky as though
                            it can only be mastered by a witch or wizard capable of facing death. </p>
